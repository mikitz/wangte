            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All cultural bonuses are interchangeable as long as the above conditions are satisfied</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physiological traits cannot be moved</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">EXAMPLE</span></em></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can move an entire race&rsquo;s stat block, excluding physiological traits (like water breathing, fire breath, etc.), to any other race in any source book.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want to have the weapon proficiencies from the elf and to put your +2 into Strength and +1 in Dexterity. You can do this as ANY race in any source book. Want it as a dwarf? Okay. As a tiefling? Okay. You pick.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to take all Variant Human features and put them on an elf? Okay! Or put them on a tiefling? Do it! What about a mountain dwarf? YES!</span></p>
