            <h1>Donate</h1>
                <p>You might have noticed that there are no advertisements on this site. I will never run ads on this site. That means the server costs are paid for entirely by donations and/or out of my own pocket. So, if you're willing to donate to the development team (of one: Mikitz; that's me! hehe), I would be sincerely grateful. </p>
                <p>Below, you'll find two tables: one shows the recommended donation based on usage and the other shows the recommended Patreon pledge level based on usage. If you're curious about paying for exactly what you use, please use the calculator below the tables. (Warning: You will likely find it excessively detailed)</p>
                <p>You can donate via any of the below methods.</p>
