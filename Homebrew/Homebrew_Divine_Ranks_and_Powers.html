             <tr><td>Rank 0</td><td>Creatures of this rank are sometimes called quasi-deities or hero deities. <br>Creatures that have a mortal and a deity as parents also fall into this category. <br>These entities cannot grant spells, but are immortal and usually have one or more ability scores that are far above the norm for their species. <br>They may have some worshipers. Ordinary mortals do not have a divine rank of 0. They lack a divine rank altogether.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>Rank 1-5</td><td>These entities, called demigods, are the weakest of the deities. <br>A demigod can grant spells and perform a few deeds that are beyond mortal limits. <br>A demigod has anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand devoted mortal worshipers and may receive veneration or respect from many more. <br>A demigod controls a small godly realm (usually on an Outer Plane) and has minor control over a portfolio that includes one or more aspects of mortal existence. <br>A demigod might be very accomplished in a single skill or a group of related skills, gain combat advantages in special circumstances, or be able to bring about minor changes in reality itself related to the portfolio.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>Rank 6-10</td><td>Called lesser deities, these entities grant spells and can perform more powerful deeds than demigods can. <br>Lesser deities have anywhere from a few thousand to tens of thousands of worshipers and control larger godly realms than demigods. <br>They also have keener senses where their portfolios are concerned</td></tr>
             <tr><td>Rank 11-15</td><td>These entities are called intermediate deities. <br>They have hundreds of thousands of mortal worshipers and control larger godly realms than demigods or lesser deities.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>Rank 16-20</td><td>Called greater deities, these entities may have millions of mortal worshipers, and they command respect even among other deities. <br>The most powerful of greater deities rule over other deities just as mortal sovereigns rule over commoners.</td></tr>
             <tr><td>Rank 21+</td><td>These entities are beyond the ken of mortals and care nothing for worshipers. <br>They do not grant spells, do not answer prayers, and do not respond to queries. <br>If they are known at all, it is to a handful of scholars on the Material Plane. <br>They are called overdeities. In some pantheistic systems, the consent of an overdeity is required to become a god.25</td></tr>
