        <h1>Street Drugs</h1>
        <p>If dependency is rolled, then the character must make a Constituion saving throw with a DC equal to the Drug Quality DC every day at the time of ingesting. The character can overcome that dependency by holding off the effects of withdrawal by successfully rolling as many Con. saves in a row as the number rolled on the duration die + the duration die maxed.
            <br><br><i>E.G. I ingest Mushrooms, but wind up with dependency. When I ingested Mushrooms, I rolled a duration of 3. I then add that roll to the max of the Mushroom duration die, which is 1d6. The max of 1d6 is 6. So, 6 + 3 = 9. I must make 9 consecutive successful Constituion saving throws in order to overcome the symptoms of withdrawal.</i>
            <br><br>Each failed Constituion saving throw brings with it a level of exhaustion and a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to the Drug Quality DC in order to overcome the one-track desire of acquiring that drug in order to satiate one's need for it.
